# We rate Dogs on Twitter analysis
 The dataset that was wrangled, analyzed and visualized is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about their dogs. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent".  The datasets used for this project was gathered across three(3) different datasets; 1. Enhanced TWitter archive which contains basic tweet data for over 5000+ tweets but unfortunately only 2356 was retrieved for analysis. This data set does not contain retweet count and likes count.  2. Twitter API was contains 3000 of their most recent tweets and infromations like retweet count and likes. The WeRateDogs Twitter account was queried to gather this data. 3.Image predictions file which was obtained by running every images in WeRateDogs to predict the the breeds of each dogs.
